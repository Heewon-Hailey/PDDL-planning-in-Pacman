# PDDL planning in Pacman

## About the project



Domain: 

A single player agent _Pacman_ moves on a given 2D grid map. ghostscan eat any food or capsules while moving adjacent location. _Pacman_ needs to eat all of the food in the map to win the game. Some locations in the map may include immobile ghosts. If _Pacman_ locate in the same cell a ghost occupies, it dies. Also, there may be capsules that make _Pacman_ invulnerable for a number of moves. During the time, ghosts can die by colliding with _Pacman_. 

There is only one action _move_ which has two paramters, locations of _Pacman_ before and after moving.
